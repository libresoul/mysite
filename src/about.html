<h2><a href="#" class="title">Hi there</a></h2>
<br />

<p>
    I am Damindu Dhananjitha-a Software Engineering undergraduate, tech
    enthusiast and the co-host of
    <a href="https://in.nartwork.lk" target="_blank">Incursion Podcast</a> from
    Sri Lanka! <br />
</p>
<p>
    You might be thinking I am a techie but I am not; more like I wasn't. I
    spent my time doing music stuff during school untill few years back (when I was
    18 or so) I started messing with nix systems which lead me to explore
    technical things that weren't interesting to me earlier and during that
    period of time, I discovered amazing things like
    <abbr title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> and currently I am
    doing somthing what I actually love, which is Computer Science at the
    moment.<br />
</p>
<p>Here, you will find me writing about technical shenanigans, tutorials and some poetry too (if I still have that person in me).</p>
