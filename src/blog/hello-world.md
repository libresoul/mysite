## Shouldn't a library be a quiet place?

Alright, I am[^1] seated again after attending a 2 hour lecture staring at the
screen of my laptop. What should I write? like for real? Should it be
philosophy that I don't care about? Or should I be a techie here? I dunno, help
me.! :(

Anyway this is something like an introduction that most bloggers do,
well I am not gonna promise that I'll be writing about a single fixed subject
but I'll try to make whatever I am writing interesting.

> _maybe the library is quiet, but not me._
